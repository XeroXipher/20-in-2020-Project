# 20-in-2020-Project
We (the team) have noticed old rap songs and videos changing. We believe we know why, we created '20 for 2020' to try to save all Music Videos  the way they were meant to be saved, for our next generations.


--THE 20 IN 2020 PROJECT IS A PROJECT ORIGINALLY STARTED IN NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA FROM A SECRET SOCIETY KNOWN AS 
THE ORDER OF THE RED MOON.
--IN 2017, A MAGICK OF GREAT POWER SCORCHED THE WORLD, AND SPREAD FAR AND WIDE.
--IN 2018 THE SAME MAGICK WAS TAMED BUT IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS TO COMPLETELY WASH IT DOWN.
--IN 2020, THE LEADER OF THE ORDER OF THE RED MOON (XeroXipher) BEGAN CONTEMPLATING HOW TO SAVE HIP HOP VIDEOS 
OR OTHER MUSIC VIDEOS THAT HAD BEGAN TO CHANGE FROM THE MAGICK.

--IN 2021, THE ORDER OF THE RED MOON BEGAN THE '20 IN 2020 PROJECT' TO FIGHT TO PRESERVE EVERY RAP/HIP HOP OR
OTHER GENRE MUSIC VIDEOS.
--AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE ALL OF OUR WORK ON PRIVATE SERVERS AND ON ARCHIVE.ORG
--AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE 1 SONG BACKED UP:
